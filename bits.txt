Important bit operations :

1. To get the position of the right most set bit
    log2(n & -n) + 1;

2. -n : All the bits are reverted except the rightmost set bit
    Example : -15 = 11110001

3. If a number is power of 2, then 
    num - 1 = rightmost bits will become 1's and leftmost bits will become 0's
    num & (num-1) = 0 if only one bit is set
