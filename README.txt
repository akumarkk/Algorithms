I am interetsed in solving algorithmic problems.
In this repository, I will code all the interesting problems that I come across.

Linkedlist	kth_node.c		Returns Kth node from the end
Linkedlist	quick_sort_arrange.c	Partition the linkedlist in such a way that nodes <x, should be to the left of the nodes >= x
