Quick select can be implemented in 3 different ways :

1. Using first item as pivot	    :	O(n)	Worst case = O(n ^ 2)
2. Get pivot position by random()   :	Average Case = theta(n), 	Worst case = O( n ^ 2)
3. Use median of medians	    :	Worst case   = O (n)

Find the position of median of medians and exchange this element with a[low] in partition step.
